I’ll show you how to create a React website with a navigation bar that routes to different pages. This requires React Router for navigation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ll create a version that works without React Router by using React state for navigation instead:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Perfect! Here’s a complete React website with a navigation bar that routes to different pages. Since we can’t use React Router in this environment, I’ve implemented navigation using React state instead.

## Key Features:

**Navigation System:**

- Clean navigation bar with logo and menu items
- Active page highlighting
- Mobile-responsive design
- Smooth transitions between pages

**Pages Included:**

- **Home** - Welcome page with feature cards
- **About** - Company information with value propositions
- **Services** - Service offerings in a grid layout
- **Contact** - Contact form and information

## To implement this in your own project:

1. **Install React Router** (for real URL routing):

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

1. **Replace the state-based navigation** with React Router:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

1. **Project Structure:**

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.js
│   └── pages/
│       ├── Home.js
│       ├── About.js
│       ├── Services.js
│       └── Contact.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

1. **Additional Features** you can add:

- Mobile hamburger menu
- Dropdown submenus
- Breadcrumbs
- Page transitions
- Search functionality
- User authentication

The example above shows a modern, responsive website with smooth navigation that you can customize with your own content, styling, and additional features!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
